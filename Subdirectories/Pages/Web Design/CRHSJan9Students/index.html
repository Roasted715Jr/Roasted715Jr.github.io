		<p>The CRHS community has made a commitment to excellence through the development of exemplary programs in the areas of the 4As:  academics, arts, athletics, and school atmosphere.</p>Participation in school-sponsored athletic programs is a PRIVILEGE, not a right that carries with it responsibilities to the school, the student body, the
		community and the participants themselves. At no time will the athletic program supersede the total educational curriculum in emphasis.</p>
